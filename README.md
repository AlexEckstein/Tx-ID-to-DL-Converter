# Tx-ID-to-DL-Converter
This is a simple program that will convert a TX ID to a DL code. These IDs are printed on security system sensors and sometimes need to be converted in order to work properly with the main panel. The program works by a hard coded method of taking in a string variable and changing it to a DL code.
